# Library

Project for Odin to practice basic object construction


## Next Step

- [ ] Turn the form into a popup
- [ ] Add a delete button to the card

## TODO

- [ ] Check specs
- [x] Create a method to display the library on page (most of this is done it's just hooking it up)
- [x] Input form
- [ ] Read toggle
- [ ] Delete button
- [x] Hook up library to local storage (probably do this at the end, unless it's useful for testing?)
- [ ] Update storage when an entry is added

### Bonus Features

- [ ] Add firebase (plus option to choose?)
- [ ] Add a view toggle (table / card)
- [ ] Fully responsive
- [ ] Recipie version with links and ratings

Think about app flow.
* Button is clicked
* Form comes up
* Book is created and pushed to array
* displayBooks is called to update DOM
* library is copied to localstorage
