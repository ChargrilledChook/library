# Library

Project for Odin to practice basic object construction

## TODO

### Core Logic

- [x] Read toggle - Working but doesn't look good visually
- [x] Form validation - Kind of but a bit hacky

### Code Organisation

- [x] Group code into sections
  - [x] Elements
  - [x] Objects
  - [x] Functions
  - [x] Listeners
- [ ] README

### UI
- [x] Turn the form into a popup
- [ ] CSS Reset
- [ ] Fonts
- [ ] Colours
- [ ] Various stylings (cards, buttons, etc)

### UX
- [x] Clear form data on submission
- [x] Pop down on submission
- [ ] Fully responsive

### Bonus Features

- [ ] Convert library object to a class
- [ ] Add different types of 'book' objects ie movie, series
- [x] Refactor to classes
- [ ] Add firebase (plus option to choose?)
- [ ] Add a view toggle (table / card)
- [ ] Recipie version with links and ratings

Think about app flow.
* Button is clicked
* Form comes up
* Book is created and pushed to array
* displayBooks is called to update DOM
* library is copied to localstorage
