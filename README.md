# Library

Project for Odin to practice basic object construction

## TODO

- [ ] Check specs
- [ ] Create a method to display the library on page (most of this is done it's just hooking it up)
- [ ] Input form
- [ ] Read toggle
- [ ] Delete button
- [ ] Hook up library to local storage (probably do this at the end, unless it's useful for testing?)

Think about app flow.
* Button is clicked
* Form comes up
* Book is created and pushed to array
* displayBooks is called to update DOM
* library is copied to localstorage
